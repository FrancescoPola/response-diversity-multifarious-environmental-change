Measuring the response diversity of ecological communities experiencing multifarious environmental change 

This repository contains data, analysis, and supplementary materials for the empirical example described in the manuscript titled "Measuring the response diversity of ecological communities experiencing multifarious environmental change ".

Contents

Data: Contains the datasets used in the empirical example shown in the file called "Appendix2_Empirical example".

Experiment: Includes the RMarkdown file (Creating the data for Response diversity in the context of multifarious environmental change.Rmd) used for the analysis and generating results mentioned in the main text.

Management: Information regarding project management and author contributions.


old: Contains deprecated or older code used in exploratory analysis.

r: Stores custom R functions used in the analysis.

Revision: contains four folders: assests; figure_revision; Reports; Rmd and R files

Usage
Data: The raw datasets are located in the Data folder.

Experiment: Run the Creating the data for Response diversity in the context of multifarious environmental change.Rmd file in the Experiment folder for reproducing the analysis.

Revision: each folder has a different use. 
(IMPORTANT: in order to be able to reproduce all the figures presented in the manuscript, you need to run first the .Rmd file called "Appedinx2_Empirical application.Rmd" contained in the folder "Rmd and R files", and save the .Rdata file generated in the last line of the document".)
- assesst: contains files for creating Appendix1 (figure of the 3D surface)
- figure_revision: stores the figures created in the .R file called "Figures_empirical.R" contained in the folder Rmd and R files. Please note the some figures have been commented in power point for the final version shown in the manuscript.
- Reports: contains the .pdf and .html files of Appendix1 and Appendix2.
- Rmd and R files: contains 3 files: "Appendix1_principle and demos.Rmd" which create the Appedix1, "Appedinx2_Empirical application" creates the Appendix2, and "figures_empirical.R" creates all the figures presented in the manuscript.

r: Contains custom functions used in the analysis.
